Some useful Git Commands


*  $ git init

	Running this command creates a hidden .git directory.

		* This .git directory is the brain/storage center for the repository.
		* It holds all of the configuration files and directories and is where all of the commits 
		  are stored.


*  $ git clone <path-to-repository-to-clone>
   $ git clone <path-to-repository-to-clone>  <new directory-name>

	The git clone command is used to create an identical copy of an existing repository.

	This command:
	    * takes the path to an existing repository
	    * by default will create a directory with the same name as the repository that's being cloned
	    * can be given a second argument that will be used as the name of the directory
	    * will create the new repository inside of the current working directory


*  $ git status

	The git status command will display the current status of the repository.

	This command will tell us about:
	    * new files that have been created in the Working Directory that Git hasn't started 
	      tracking, yet
	    * files that Git is tracking that have been


*  $ git log

	By default, this command displays:

	    * the SHA
	    * the author
	    * the date
	    * and the message

  $ git log --oneline

  	the --oneline flag is used to alter how git log displays information

	This command:
	    * lists one commit per line
	    * shows the first 7 characters of the commit's SHA
	    * shows the commit's message

  $ git log --stat

    the --stat flag is also used to alter how git log displays information.

	This command:
	    * displays the file(s) that have been modified
	    * displays the number of lines that have been added/removed
	    * displays a summary line with the total number of modified files and lines that 
	      have been added/removed

  $ git log -p

    the -p flag (which is the same as the --patch flag) is also used to alter how git log 
    displays information

	This command adds the following to the default output:
	    * displays the files that have been modified
	    * displays the location of the lines that have been added/removed
	    * displays the actual changes that have been made

    you can supply the SHA of a commit as the final argument for all of these commands? 
    For example:   $ git log -p fdf5493


*  $ git show

	The git show command will show only one commit. So don't get alarmed when you can't find any other 
	commits - it only shows one. The output of the git show command is exactly the same as the 
	git log -p command.

	 So by default, git show displays:
	    * the commit
	    * the author
	    * the date
	    * the commit message
	    * the patch information

	However, git show can be combined with most of the other flags we've looked at:

	    * --stat - to show the how many files were changed and the number of lines that 
	      were added/removed
	    * -p or --patch - this the default, but if --stat is used, the patch won't display, so 
	      pass -p to add it again
	    * -w - to ignore changes to whitespace



*  $ git add <file1> <file2> â€¦ <fileN>

	The git add command is used to move files from the Working Directory to the Staging Index.

	This command:
	    * takes a space-separated list of file names
	    * alternatively, the period . can be used in place of a list of files to tell Git to add 
	    the current directory (and all nested files)


*  $ git commit

	The git commit command takes files from the Staging Index and saves them in the repository.

	This command:
		* will open the code editor that is specified in your configuration

	Inside the code editor:

	    * a commit message must be supplied
	    * lines that start with a # are comments and will not be recorded
	    * save the file after adding a commit message
	    * close the editor to make the commit


*  $ git diff

	the git diff command is used to see changes that have been made but haven't been committed, yet.

	This command displays:
    	* the files that have been modified
    	* the location of the lines that have been added/removed
    	* the actual changes that have been made
